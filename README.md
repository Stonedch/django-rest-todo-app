## Authentication

Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens.
The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:

```
Authorization: Token <token>
```

You can obtain auth token by making a `POST` request to the`/api/auth/login/` endpoint with user's credentials:

```javascript
{
   "username": "admin",
   "password": "admin"
}
```

In response you will receive a `access-token` that is used in the `Authorization` header for authentication.
